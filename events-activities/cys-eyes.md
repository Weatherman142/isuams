Cy's Eyes on the Skies is the weather show at ISU and is the university's longest running television show. This completely student-run program meets twice weekly to produce a 15-minute weather broadcast. Founded in 1999, the main purpose of the show has been to give students wanting to pursue a career in broadcast meteorology a chance to practice their on-air skills by working with a green screen and gain experience making weather graphics. 

In August, 2011, Cy's Eyes on the Skies upgraded to the state of the art graphics system known as Fusion by WSI. This, along with the move to a new studio in 171 Hamilton Hall in fall 2014 has helped students to learn even more about a career in broadcast meteorology than ever before. 

Beginning in August of 2022, Cy's Eyes on the Skies started to transition away from Fusion and go to WSI Max. In addition to the change of the graphics system, Cy's Eyes on the Skies moved to a 0140 Student Innovation Center, which is a brand new studio in the basement of the recently built campus building. This took longer than expected, however, and Cy's Eyes on the Skies didn't air any episodes from 2022 to the start of 2024. Fortunately, in February of 2024, Cy's Eyes on the Skies returned to forecast the weather for students at Iowa State and across the nation.

If a student wishes to be involved but not go on air, extra assistance is always needed with the production side of each show. Students operate cameras, teleprompter, audio and commercial servers and can serve as floor director, making them even more well rounded for a future in the broadcast business.
