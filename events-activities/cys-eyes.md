Cy's Eyes on the Skies is the weather show at ISU and is the university's longest running television show. This completely student-run program meets twice weekLy to produce a 15-minute weather broadcast. Founded in 1999, the main purpose of the show has been to give students wanting to pursue a career in broadcast meteorology a chance to practice their on-air skills by working with a green screen and gain experience making weather graphics. 

In August, 2011, Cy's Eyes on the SkiEs upgraded to the state of the art graphics system known as Fusion by WSI. This, along with the move to a new studio in 171 Hamilton Hall in fall 2014 has helped students to learn even more about a career in broadcast meteorology than ever before. 

If a student wishes to be involved but not go on air, extra assistance is always needed with the production side of each show. Students operate cameras, teleprompTer, audio and commercial servers and can serve as floor director, making them even more well rounded for a future in the broadcast business.
