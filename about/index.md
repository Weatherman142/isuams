<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>ISU AMS is a local student chapter of the American Meteorological Society and a non-profit,
student-run organization at Iowa State University. Our organization seeks to achieve four main
purposes: to promote interest in the atmospheric sciences and related fields of study, to provide
fellowship among students and faculty, to serve the interests of our members and of the
meteorological community, and to provide the community with a social and scientific point of
contact for meteorological interests, specifically through educational outreach.</p>
 
What do we do?
As the five-time winner of the Outstanding Student Chapter of the Year, ISU AMS knows a thing
or two about how to have a good time! One of the primary goals of ISU AMS is to provide a
welcoming environment for all of our members. Through a wide-variety of social events, our
organization works to establish a tight-knit community connected by our love for weather. Some
of our most popular events include (but are definitely not limited to): the radar and chasing
workshop, the student/faculty dinner, Center Grove Apple Orchard, the fall bonfire, holiday
caroling, and the Chili Cook-Off! 

Aside from social events, ISU AMS also has an outstanding outreach program. From visiting
local K-12 schools to volunteering at science nights, our organization is always busy working to
educate the community on weather. Some of our newest events include: the Girls in Science
Festival, the AMS Winter Coat Drive, and the AMS Science Fair!

Finally, if ISU AMS isn’t educating others, we’re educating ourselves! Given the rigorous
workload of the meteorology major, we encourage students to work together to improve their
grades. Our academic chair hosts review sessions for all of the meteorology classes in addition
to weekly tutoring sessions for math classes. As a result, our chapter has been selected for the
AMS Honor Roll nearly a dozen times. 

When is it? 
ISU AMS holds monthly meetings on the last Tuesday of each month at 7:00 PM. Meetings last
for approximately one hour and will discuss the details of upcoming events (all of which will be
listed on our calendar). Additionally, each meeting has food!
 
How do I join?
To join, simply attend a meeting and pay your dues to the treasurer.  While the majority of our
members are Meteorology majors, any current student at Iowa State University is eligible for
membership. We encourage all weather fanatics to join!
